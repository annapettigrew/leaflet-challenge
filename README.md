Create an Earthquake Visualization using Leaflet

I started by visualizing an earthquake dataset and completed the following steps:

- The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every five minutes. I chose the dataset of all earthquakes in the last 7 Days
- After openng the link a JSON version of the data is provided

Next, I imported and visualized the data by doing the following:

- Using Leaflet, I created a map that plots all the earthquakes from my chosen dataset based on the longitude and latitude.
- The data markers reflects the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

This includes:
- Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
- A legend that will provide context for the map data.
